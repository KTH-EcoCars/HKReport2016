\chapter{Purpose}

Why is is this project even interesting?

Lowering fuel consumption is one of the main challenges for the automotive 
industry. Regularly new standards for permitted emissions are passed and  
one solution is to burn less fuel, which results in less emissions.

Hybrid vehicles have been growing in popularity over the last decade and 
more lately so called "plug in" hybrids have emerged. These cars allows one 
to charge the car with electrical energy at home, potentially at a low price.

ElBa can be called a plug in hybrid and reducing fuel (and energy) consumption is the goal of SEM. But since the the style of hybrid is very unique, with the triple motor/ engine combination, the problem of reducing the fuel consumption is not trivial. 

\section{The Problem}
When driving any car around a track some parameters and variables have a large effect of how much energy is used to propel the car forwards. Speed, weight, drag and friction are the first that comes into mind. Both drag and speed is increased with speed.
