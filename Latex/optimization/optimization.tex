%Introduction
\section{Introduction}
The main goal of the project is to have the car consume the least amount of fuel
possible.  In the ideal world shall the engines and motors therefore always
operate within a certain range of their optimal point of operation. The torque
request from each of the engine/motors should consider this in order to reduce
fuel consumption. In addition to this goal, there is a number of constraints
that needs to be considered in addition to the generic fuel consumption
optimization.  Things like track topography, super-capacitor voltage,
competitors on the track etc.\ will all weight in on the output request. The
optimization algorithm used in Elbas automatic drive mode was developed as a
part of a Master Thesis~\cite{liu2016}. The control architecture for this
optimization consists of two or three layers and the thesis have completed the
top layer speed reference control. This chapter will cover the decentralized
hierarchical predictive control that is used to calculate the speed trajectory
and it's implementation.

\section{Design Decisions}
The need for an optimization can seem obvious in order to lower fuel
consumption. However, depending on the tracks topography there might be other
areas that would need much more consideration and tings like weight, frontal
area and rolling friction might have a grater impact in some cases. In recent
years the track of SEM have been more or less flat, with only minor deviations
in altitude. With this track, the considerations for an automated drive mode
would more or less only consist of making sure that the voltage level of the
super capacitor is within it's boundaries. This means that the ICE needs to be
started when the voltage level gets too low and regenerate energy into the super
capacitor. The reason for this is that the efficiency of the electrical motors
exceeds that of the ICE, and in so it will be more efficient to drive Elba with
the electrical motors.  Once SEM moved to London, where the altitude changes of
the track is much more significant, the conditions became different. On top of
the voltage level of the super capacitor there is also room for optimizing the
torque requests so that the most efficient propulsion constellation is active at
all times. It is also nessesary to time the accessible energy so that there is
enough energy in the super capacitor in beginning of an uphill, the possibility
to regenerate from driving downhill etc.\ all added to the complexity of the
optimization.  These new levels of complexity makes the optimization become more
of an factor then previous years, and in so there was a collaboration with a
master thesis student who used Elba as an experiment in the
thesis~\cite{liu2016}.

The Simulink lookup table that was produced from~\cite{liu2016} was dependent on
the distance traveled on the track and in so there was a real need to get an
accurate position reading. There was two options, to get an GPS-positioning
device and get that to talk with the rest of the car, or to use the encoder
already mounted on the drive shaft. Both had their disadvantages, with the
encoder reading having the tendency to drift and the inaccuracy of the path
chosen on the track and the GPS with its CEP of $\pm2.5\textnormal{m}$. When the
RCP2 was bought it came with an GPS solution already implemented, this made the
choice of having both of them easier, more can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:opt_pos_recon}. The next problem arouse was to filer the
readings of both the GPS and the encoder to have a reliable positioning source.
Due to priorities and limited amounts of time, is the filtering currently not
implemented. 

\section{Constraints}
The optimization is limited by the constraints of the physical system, meaning that
the controller is not able to operate outside the limits of the system. These limits
are,
\begin{align}
    &U_{cap} \in [39,48]~\textup{V} \\
    &\nu \in [0,15]~\textup{m/s}\\
    &a_{\max} \in [-1,1]~\textup{m/s$^2$}
\end{align}
where $U_{cap}$ is the voltage level of the super-capacitor, $\nu$ is the speed
and $a$ is the acceleration in every time step. Due to the fact that there is a
lower limit to the voltage level of the super-capacitor, it is necessary to
change drive mode to engage the ICE in order to regenerate and store energy
until the upper limit is reached. Since the optimization is currently only done
in the top layer, there is a need for the voltage limit to be considered
manually in the model.

\section{Position recognition}\label{sec:opt_pos_recon}
The optimization bases the output reference speed on the current position on the
track. This yields the need for a position recognition with an accuracy precise
enough to be able filter it with sufficient results. The track itself, rather
then time is discretized in order to get a more accurate position in relation to
the tracks topography. \\
There is two ways of finding Elba's position on the track. The first way is a dead
reckoning system based on the shaft encoder~\cite[p.~49]{elba2015},
which calculates the position based on the rotational speed of the shaft. The
second way is based on the GPS system implemented in the race capture pro 2,
where the GPS signal is taken from it's raw form and reshaped with a
Lua-script\footnote{Lua is a dynamically typed scripting language, www.lua.org}
into a CAN-message that is sent on the CAN-bus.


\section{Simulink implementation}
The complete description of the algorithm is found in~\cite{liu2016} and the
implementation is based on this thesis.  There is a function for calculating the
distance traveled from the encoder, this takes the absolute dead reckoning
position calculated from the shaft encoder and an indicator for a new lap, as
input. When the indicator for a new lap is pressed, the dead reckoning position
is zeroed in the function block and the position is calculated and delivered as
the output. The position should then be sent to a Particle Filter block where
both the dead reckoning and the GPS position is inputed.  However, the Particle
Filter itself is not implemented at the moment and is considered to be something
future groups need to work on. These two positioning systems is supposed to be
used to get the estimation of the distance Elba have traveled on the track.

There are three inputs into the three dimensional optimization lookup-table, the
first one is time. This input is used to synchronize the different time scales
in the table and Simulink. The speed input is read from the CAN-bus and is the
current speed of Elba. The track position is the calculated distance traveled
on the track from the filter. The output of the block is an acceleration
reference which needs to be converted to an reference speed since Elba is
currently controlled with speed request. 

\section{Simulation}

\subsection{Static reference speed}\label{sec:opt_sim_static}
One lap around the track was simulated using the plant model with a constant reference speed of 7 m/s (the slowest allowed speed to be able to complete the race in time). %The resulting speed and vehicle height position can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:optimization_static_speed} 

%TODO: Frågan är om denna ska med alls...

%    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/optimization_static_speed.eps}
%    \caption{Plots of vehicle height and speed as a function of time.}
%\end{figure}

The fuel consumption in $\textnormal{km/l}$ fuel, $f_c$ was calculated according to

\begin{equation} \label{eq:optimization_fuelconsumption}
	f_{tot} = \frac{d_l}{f_i+f_c},
\end{equation}

where $d_l$ is the distance of one lap, $f_i$ the fuel consumed by the ICE and
$f_c$ the equivalent amount of fuel that the super capacitor has been discharged
by since the start of the race, calculated as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:optimization_ethanolenergy}
	f_c = \frac{({{u_{c_0}}^2-{u_{c_{end}}}^2})c_c}{2k},
\end{equation}

where $u_{c_0}$ is the initial capacitor voltage, $u_{c_{end}}$ is the capacitor
voltage at the end of the race, $c_c$ is the capacitance in the capacitor and
$k$ is the conversion ratio from litre ethanol to energy in joule, retrieved
from~\cite{fuelconversion}.

This resulted in $f_{tot} = 172.8$ $km/l$. %TODO: göra snyggare

\subsection{Optimized reference speed}\label{sec:opt_sim_static}
Using the optimized speed controller as a lookup table (produced by
\citep{liu2016}) dependant on vehicle speed, distance and elapsed time, a new
simulation could be produced. The resulting speed and vehicle height position
can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:optimization_optimal_speed}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/optimization_optimal_speed.eps}
    \caption{Plots of vehicle height and speed as a function of
    time.}\label{fig:optimization_optimal_speed}
\end{figure}

The amount of kilometers travelled per liter fuel $f_{tot}$ was calculated
according to equation~\ref{eq:optimization_fuelconsumption}. This resulted in
$f_{tot} = 194.1$ $km/l$. %TODO: göra snyggare
