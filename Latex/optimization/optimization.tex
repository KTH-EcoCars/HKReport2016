\chapter{Optimization}
\section{Introduction}
The main goal of the project is to have the car consume the least amount of fuel possible. In the ideal world should the engines and motors therefor always operate within a certain the range of their optimal point of operation. The torque request from each of the engine/motors should be with this goal in mind in order to reduce fuel comsumption. In addition to this goal, there is a number of constraints that needs to be considered on top of this generic optimization. Things like track topography, super-capacitor voltage, competitors on the track etc. will all weigh in on the output request. In this chapter we will cover the cascaded (?) optimization algorithm that will calculate the speed trajectory.
