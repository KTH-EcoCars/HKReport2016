\begin{abstract}
As the population on earth increases so does the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This has a huge impact on the environment on our planet and there are many incentives to break this trend. Since the automotive industry is one of the main culprits today, a lot of focus is on reducing the amount of emission from vehicles. Shell Eco Marathon is an international event where students are allowed to build vehicles and compete in fuel-efficiency.\\

\noindent
This report cover the work on project Elba where a hybrid vehicle was upgraded and modified to run on ethanol. In addition an optimal speed trajectory controller were designed and implemented to minimize energy consumption.
A rolling highway, or a test rig, were designed and constructed to be able to test the cars performance on any, simulated, track's height-profile. 
The theoretical performance was evaluated, which estimated that the car would have a mileage of 197 km/litre ethanol if run on the competition track located in London.

Without a few key-persons this project would never have been possible, and not
as successful. The entire experience has been great and we have learned more
than we could ever imagine.  We would first and foremost like to thank Mikael Hellgren for
being the driving force behind KTH Eco Cars, and also Lei Feng for supervising the
project and for making the optimization possible. We
would also like to thank Björn Möller for your belief in the project and allowing for a dialogue between the project course and the actual project.
The team would also like to
thank the other groups within the project who made large contributions to the car before the
competition, and managing to almost get the car to complete an attempt.  There
are more people who also contributed knowledge and helped in one way or another,
both from ITRL and the Mechatronics institution.  Naturally many people are
involved in a big project like this and being a part and directing it is
something we will never forget.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
There have often been a sense of distance between students and faculty staff, 
but during this project the feeling have
been the opposite, the ITM/mechatronics faculty have always been available.

\noindent
We are also grateful for our sponsors:

ITRL for sponsoring and housing the project.

SKF for providing bearings and actuators.

ECO2 and SHC for your sponsoring support.

\noindent
We also wish to thank Shell for an excellent event and the opportunity to meet our idol
Kimi Räikkönen.
