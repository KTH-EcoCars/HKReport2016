\begin{abstract}
A hybrid vehicle, built to compete in Shell Eco-Marathon, was upgraded and modified to run on ethanol. In addition an optimal speed trajectory controller where designed and implemented to minimize energy consumption.
A roling highway, or a test rig, where designed and constructed to be able to test the cars performance on any, simulated, track's high-profile. 
The theoretical performance was evaluated, which estimated that the car would have a mileage of 197 km/litre ethanol if run on the competition track.

Without a few key-persons this project would never have been possible, and not
as successful. The entire experience has been great and we have learned more
than we could ever imagine.  We would first and foremost like to thank Mikael Hellgren for
being the driving force behind KTH Eco Cars, and also Lei Feng for supervising the
project and for making the optimization possible.  The team would also like to
thank the other groups within the project who made large contributions to the car before the
competition, and managing to almost get the car to complete an attempt.  There
are more people who also contributed knowledge and helped in one way or another,
both from ITRL and the Mechatronics institution.  Naturally many people are
involved in a big project like this and being a part and directing it is
something we will never forget.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
There have often been a sense of distance between students and the faculty in
many of the previous courses taken at KTH\@. During this project the feeling have
been the opposite, the mechatronics faculty have always been available and there
have been a real sense of unity between the teaching staff and the students in
the Eco Cars project. Our sincerest gratitude goes out to Mikael Hellgren for
your continuous support and guidance during the entire length of the project. We
would also like to thank Björn Möller for your belief in the project and allowing
the dialogue to be two sided. Our gratitude also goes out to Lei Feng for your
supervision of the project, ITRL for sponsoring and housing the project and SKF,
ECO2 and SHC for your sponsoring support.
