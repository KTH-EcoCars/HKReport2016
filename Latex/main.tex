Without a few key-persons this project would never have been possible, and not as successful. The entire experience has been great and we have learned more than we could ever imagine.

First we would like to thank Mikael Hellgren for being the driving force behind KTH Eco Cars and to Lei Feng for supervising the project and for making the optimisation possible.

The team would also like to thank the other subgroups who made large contributions to the car before the competition, and managing to almost get the car to complete an attempt.

There are more people who also contributed knowledge and helped in one way or another, both from ITRL and the Mechatronics institution.

Naturally many people are involved in a big project like this and being a part and directing it is something we will never forget.

There have often been a sense of distance between students and the faculty in
many of the previous courses taken at KTH. Douring this project the feeling have
been the opposite, the mechatronics faculty have always been available and there
have been a real sens of unity between the teaching staff and the students in
the Eco Cars project. Our sincerest graditude goes out to Mikael Hellgren for
your continuous support and guidence during the entire length of the project. We
would also like to thank Björn Möller for your belief in the project and allowing
the dialogue to be two sided. Our gratitude also goes out to Lei Feng for your
supervision of the project, ITRL for sponsoring and housing the project and SKF,
ECO2 and SHV for your sponsoring support.
