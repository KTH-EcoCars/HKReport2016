List of stuff to work on:

1. Separate ground between logic and power in testrig. Not possible because of the way we measure voltage. Should share logic ground with ESCON driver.

2. Map ICE parameters.

3. Improve parameters of Elba in the plant model.

4. Local optimization? Not State flow.

5. Improve clutch

6. Implement particle filter

7. Fix CAN receive from RCP to Front ECU

8. Add more interesting data to CAN msg from RCP

9. Fix instrumentation panel

10. Make the testrig to one unit i.e. mount the ECU on the testrig and make the wiring better.

11. Make the door hinges more robust\\

This list of improvements cover all of the different projects and teams that work with Elba the car.
