\chapter{Discussion}
The purpose of this section is to give the authors thoughts and considerations
on how the different design decisions and project as a whole have turned out
with the benefit of hindsight. Not everything have been clear from the begining
and a lot of lessons have been learned along the way. The easiest way to
communicate this is to start with the project as a whole and then move into the
different parts of the project one by one.
