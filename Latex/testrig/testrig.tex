\chapter{Testrig}
\section{Introduction}
When designing a complex system such as a hybrid vehicle, being continuously be
able to test the system is important to validate that the requirements are met
and to verify the models. To be able to do a full system test, the car has to be
physically run on a track. This can be cumbersome, or in the case of the London
track, impossible at times. Therefore, a test rig is designed and built. The
design process uses the V-model approach with a set of live requirements and
continuous unit and integration testing. The overall goal is to not only be able
to do a faithful simulation of the EcoCar track in London, but to be able to
supply any track (with certain limitations on power and speed demands) to the
test rig and simulations on the car.

\section{Requirements}
The requirements on the test rig are designed to capture the essential demands
on the system. Firstly, the high level User requirements are set. These are set
to capture the problem and to describe the goal of designing the system
~\cite{ibm_req}. The User requirements are then developed into the System
requirements that describe the limitations and demands on the system and its
subsystems.

\section{Car dynamics}
The calculations in this section are in many ways the same as the calculations
given in the previous teams report in Appendix~\ref{app:elba2015}. Though some
of the equations are repetition of what was done last year, they are
done here again with some improvements and more references to make the
derivations of the equations clearer. 

When simulating a track, one needs to know the force exerted by the environment
on the car. A graphical representation of the forces that act on the car is
given in Figure~\ref{fig:testrig_elbadynamics}.

The motion equations on the system are 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testrig_cardynamics}
    m\ddot{x} = F_d + mg\sin{\alpha} - F_c - F_{\mu},
\end{equation}
where $F_d$ is the effective driving force of the car, $m$ is the mass of the
car and $alpha$ is the slope from the horizontal plane. The resistance terms
$F_c$ and $F_{\mu}$ are air and road resistance, respectively. The air drag $D$
around an object can be calculated as \cite{nakayama2002}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testrig_airdrag}
    D = C_D A \frac{\rho v^2} {2}
\end{equation}
with object velocity $v$, surface area vertical to the movement direction $A$
and air density $\rho$. Most terms in Equation~(\ref{eq:testrig_cardynamics})
are constant throughout a driving instance. Rewriting to
\begin{equation} \label{eq:testrig_csimple}
    C_{tot} = \frac{C_D A \rho} {2}
\end{equation}
yields a simplified equation that only depends on the velocity,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:drag}
    F_D = C_{tot}v^2.
\end{equation}
The total drag coefficient $C_{tot}$ will depend on the vertical area, the density of
air and the drag coefficient $C_D$. The air density is considered to be constant
and is known. The area of Elba can be estimated using simple methods. Finally,
the air drag coefficient $C_D$ is unique to each and every object and is
determined experimentally. For this project, the estimations given for a
passenger car is used. Detailed calculations and values are given in
Appendix~\ref{app:rigdata}.

Modelled negative forces acting on vehicle (gravity, air resistance, friction):

Torque required on wheel of ELBA:$$T_w = F_n\*r_w$$

Torque required for roller on test rig: $$T_r = \frac{T_w\*r_r}{r_w}$$

Required torque for motor, $T_m$: $$T_m = T_t + J_r\*\ddot{\phi} + d\*\dot{\phi}_m + k\*\phi_m$$

Power required for motor: $$P_m = T_m\*\dot{\phi}_m$$

The inertia $J_r$ for the rollers on the testrig was calculated to be $0.0039$ $kgm^2$

This results in $P_m = 1000$ W
